4.4.1 Postnatal development
A mouse is born naked with closed ears and eyes, and if a female, with a closed vagina. 
Hair begins to appear at 2-4 days, ears open at 3-5 days, and eyes open at about 14 days. 
Typically, the vagina opens at 24-28 days of age, but it can be delayed in some mice until they are 35-40 days old. 
As soon as the eyes are fully functional, at about 16 days, pups will begin to eat solid food. 
However, nursing can continue to at least the end of the third week and sometimes a week or more longer. 
By the end of the third week of life, a young mouse resembles the adult in every aspect other than size and sexual differentiation
